# Contributing

The FabriconDev Engineering Architecture is considered a living, breathing document that can changed based off of new requirements, the changing indistry, or lessons learned. All technologists are encouraged to participate in the conversation around the architecture. The Architecture is [Open Source][open source] which means we are not only open to, but hoping for feedback and contributions back to the architecture from the community.

## Contributing Directly to the Architecture

### Issue Creation

The [Issues tab of the Architectures Repository][issues] is where we keep the backlog of work that needs to be completed in the Architecture. If something seems to be missing from the Architecture, create an issue bringing it to light. Providing more details is always more helpful in resolivng any issues found.

Great examples of Issues:

* Malformed content
* Missing supporting documentation
* Content to be added from the [RFC Process][rfcs]
* Process Change

Bad Examples of Issues:

* Non-actionable issues
* Recommendations of topics to cover in the Architecture
* Spelling and grammer mistakes.

We want all issues to be clear and actionable. Issues that ask questions are ok, as long as they lead to something actionable. For recommendations on topics, we'd like to direct all of those to the [RFCs Process][rfcs], which has been stood up to help get topics discussed, decided on, and pushed into the Architecture. For spelling and grammer mistakes, we encourage the community to take direct action and submit a pull request fixing the issue rather than submitting an issue for a thumbs up to do it.

## PUll Requests

Community members are encouraged to enage in the change process for the Architecture, either by taking on issues and submitting [pull requests][pulls] or by providing feedback and approving pull requests themselves. The feedback is much appriciated and goes to help the Architecture in being an open, collaborative project.

## Contributing to the Architecture Process

The content of the Architecture is populated via the [RFCs][rfcs].  Community members can [contribute] RFC's here to help push ideas and content to the Architecture. Contributions should follow a [Standard Template][template].
