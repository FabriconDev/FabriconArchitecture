# Fabricon.Dev: Official Home of Fabricon Architecture

## What is Fabricon?

Fabricon is an architectural framework on how to manage software projects on [Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview) using data engineering and software engineering best practices.

## What does it offer?

Fabricon aims to provide guidance on how to manage software projects of varying complexities. It offers guidance on:

1. Environment separation
2. Medallion architecture
3. Code organization using notebooks
4. Source control
5. Unit testing
6. Automated documentation
7. Branching strategy
8. Deployment to production

## Who is it for?

Fabricon aims to introduce data engineering teams to software engineering best practices, and to introduce software engineering teams to data engineering best practices under one umbrella.

## What is the goal?

Our goal is to win community contributions and adoption to an extent that when someone say "we use Fabricon 1", people know exactly it means.

## The back story?

The engineering team at [Unite Digital LLC](https://unitedigital.com) was tasked with building a new product that required processing of large volumes of data. The engineering team, with no prior experience in data engineering / big data, did not find comprehensive guidance on how to build reliable products on big data platforms. The team spent countless hours gathering information from blogs, documentation sites and video series from the internet. We would like to share our findings with the community to enable faster and easier adoption of [Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview).
